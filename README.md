# iplogger-status

This is a script to get close to real time information about your logged ips from https://iplogger.org using python requests and BeautifulSoup.
I don't think this actually has a use i just though it would look more 'hacky' seeing your logged ips in terminal close to real time haha.

# Installation

git clone https://github.com/verdoSee/iplogger-status.git
cd iplogger-status
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirments.txt
