# iplogger-status

This is a script to get close to real time updates for your logged ips from https://iplogger.org using python requests and BeautifulSoup.
I don't think this actually has a use i just though it would look more 'hacky' seeing your logged ips in terminal close to real time haha.

# Installation


<code> git clone https://github.com/verdoSee/iplogger-status.git</code>
<br>
<code>cd iplogger-status</code>
<br>
<code>python3 -m venv venv</code>
<br>
<code>source venv/bin/activate</code>
<br>
<code>python3 -m pip install -r requirments.txt</code>
<br>
<strong> Then make sure to refactor the script providing your url's  id  and  your PHPSESSID in the lines with the "#Here" comment</strong>
<br>
<code> python3 logger.py</code>
